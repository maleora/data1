				<p class="description">
					Curvy girl Cassidy Blue had her heart broken when she caught her fiance and her younger sister together. Despite the scandalous nature of their relationship, the town has chosen to pretend Cassidy never happened - well, everyone except Cassidy of course.Cassidy becomes untethered as she faces the impending nuptials, losing her grandmother&#39;s home to her sister who will inherit it after the wedding, a mother who can&#39;t choose between her daughters, and a town of romantics dead set on embracing the wedding even as it destroys Cassidy&#39;s heart.Cass finds distraction from her anger in an unlikely place - the arms of her ex-fiance&#39;s older brother, Jason King. Home for a few weeks from his city-boy, New York investor life, he quiets her mind by satisfying her body. For Cass, he&#39;s the perfect salve to heal her wounds. He&#39;s temporary and insatiable and seems to want a plus-sized girl like Cassidy...

				<h3>More About <span>The Curvy Sister</span></h3>
				<p></p>
				<p>I hated the younger sister in this book so very very much and the ending where we forgive her because she is our sister, just did not sit well with me. Other things I did not like, was the protagonist having sex without us witnessing it. I was like, hello, I am here for the sexy bits and your telling me that sometimes you leave the... After finding her sister and fiancee naked, Cassidy Blue held her head up high and went on with her life. However everyone else around her pretended nothing happened and now they are celebrating her sister and ex-fiancee&#39;s nuptials to be. Cassidy though has had it with another dagger shot her way she retaliates only to be pulled aside... This book was really good. From the beginning it had me like :(if it was me I would do way more damage- just saying)My emotions were all over the place!In general I really enjoined &#34;The Curvy Sister&#34;. The ending was...not enough, that&#39;s why I gave only 4 stars.</p>
