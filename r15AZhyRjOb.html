Once she had checked into the hotel and Ella Carey, The House by the Lake // Hitler promises that the nervous years have ended, that with him, the German way of life will be determined for the next thousand years.

Of course, the one in Germany was fictional, but made for a great story.This was a great story and such a sad one, as well.... Flat, flat, flat.
