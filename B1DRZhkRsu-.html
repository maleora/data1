					Julia Dorning is about to lose it. Between her over-the-top wedding that her sister, Anna, took upon herself to create, and the under-staffed popular bakery that she runs, she can barely find time to breathe. All Julia ever wanted was a quaint wedding on the beach with family and friends. But now Julia has to contend with not only her sister&#39;s plans, but those of her future mother-in-law, as well. Not wanting to step on anyone&#39;s toes, especially her mother-in-law&#39;s, Julia just goes along with it.She can only take so much, though, and when her newest employee, Kate, makes things harder at the bakery, Julia has to find a way to simplify her life. Can she do it or will she end up a basket case? Find out how she does it in this hilarious conclusion to the Spinster series!

				<h3>More About <span>Thirty-Four Going on Bride</span></h3>
				<p></p>
				<p>This was mostly a fun read- very much a chick lit novel!Julia is 34, and engaged and about to be married to the man of her dreams... and nonetheless, her life is falling apart. Mostly, at age 34, she has not yet learned to say NO to anyone&#39;s expectations. This is especially true for her sister, who both wants to plan Julia&#39;s wedding... This book was sold to me as hilarious. I may have laughed once. I found Julie annoying. Basically this book outlines her stress and how poorly she handles it. 3.5 rounding upBecky Monson is so good at writing sarcastic, dry humor. I can&#39;t tell you how often I was sniggering (I realize that isn&#39;t really a word but it fits perfectly for what I was doing. Not snickering, sniggering.) I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s funny stuff. I love the humor.I&#39;ve read this whole series now and it&#39;s been an interesting...</p>
