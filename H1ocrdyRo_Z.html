				<p class="description">
					Reading his own newspaper&#39;s obituaries, veteran reporter Carter Ross comes across that of a woman named Nancy Marino, who was the victim of a hit-and-run while she was on the job delivering copies of that very paper, the Eagle-Examiner. Struck by the opportunity to write a heroic piece about an everyday woman killed too young, he heads to her wake to gather tributes and anecdotes. It&#39;s the last place Ross expects to find controversy—which is exactly what happens when one of Nancy&#39;s sisters convinces him that the accident might not have been accidental at all.It turns out that the kind and generous Nancy may have made a few enemies, starting with her boss at the diner where she was a part-time waitress, and even including the publisher of the...

				<p>No way you can get stuck. Your head is much smaller. Look at this big coconut of mine. It&#39;s practically Jupiter. Yours is more like, I don&#39;t know, Mercury or something.&#34;&#34;That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going along with an idea that you&#39;re pulling out of Uranus.&#34;We both stopped to snicker. Hard to resist a Uranus joke. Brad Parks, The Girl Next Door // one sign of a well-led life is that you have great stories to tell when its over. Brad Parks, The Girl Next Door // What the hell happened to you?&#34; she demanded. &#34;What took so long?&#34;&#34;My car got towed.&#34;&#34;Okay, but why did you swim here?&#34;&#34;I walked. It just happens to be a hundred and fifty-seven degrees outside. Brad Parks, The Girl Next Door //</p>
				<p>I enjoyed reading what Carter was up to this time. However, I think it&#39;s time for some Swedish mysteries to shake things up :) Carter Ross reads a story about a woman involved in a hit and run. He decides to attend her funeral. Carter gets more than he bargained for when the victims sister tells Carter that she believes the accident was no accident. Carter agrees to investigate the case. Carter better watch his back or he could find himself in a hit and run... &#34;The Girl Next Door&#34; was a good &#34;who done it&#34;. Brad has a great way of creating characters who are believable and entertaining! I have read two of his books now and going to read the third tomorrow. Keep writing Brad, enjoyed meeting you at the Bon Air Library.</p>
