					Like many of his generation, Bill Bryson backpacked across Europe in the early seventies -- in search of enlightenment, beer, and women. Twenty years later he decided to retrace the journey he undertook in the halcyon days of his youth. The result is Neither Here Nor There, an affectionate and riotously funny pilgrimage from the frozen wastes of Scandinavia to the chaotic tumult of Istanbul, with stops along the way in Europe&#39;s most diverting and historic locales.

				<h3>More About <span>Neither here nor there: Travels in Europe</span></h3>
				<p>This was 1990 the year that communism died in Europe and it seemed strange to me that in all the words that were written about the fall of the iron curtain, nobody anywhere lamented that it was the end of a noble experiment. I know that communism never worked and I would have disliked living under it myself but none the less it seems that there was a kind of sadness in the thought that the only economic system that appeared to work was one based on self interest and greed. Bill Bryson, Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe // There is something about the momentum of travel that makes you want to just keep moving, to never stop. Bill Bryson, Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe // Italians are entirely without any commitment to order. They live their lives in a kind of pandemonium, which I find very attractive. Bill Bryson, Neither here nor there: Travels in Europe //</p>

I was trying to let some other ignorant comments go but then the chapter on Paris began. He goes on about how lights in French hotels are on a timer causing... Bill Bryson is amazing. He captures the essence of the peculiarities of travel.. of people in general. I read this before going to London (also read Noted from a Small Island- about England which was also excellent).. If you&#39;ve traveled or want to travel, it&#39;s a great little book full of entertaining short stories. I read part of the... This book was highly entertaining at times, I can&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t. In fact, it was highly entertaining most of the time. However, I can&#39;t say I learned hardly anything about any of the places Bill Bryson visited. He reserves most of his commentary for how far he walked to get to a train station, how fast or slow the train rides were,...</p>
